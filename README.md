## 🧩 Featured Projects

### 🔐 [CodeEsc – Java Puzzle Game](https://github.com/EECS3311F24/project-codeesc)
An interactive escape room puzzle desktop game built with **Java Swing** and **JDBC**. Players explore rooms, solve logic puzzles under time pressure, and submit scores to a live **MySQL leaderboard**. Designed for competitive fun with a clean user interface.

> 🛠️ Java · Swing · MySQL · JDBC  
> 🎯 Highlight: Real-time leaderboard connection + object interaction system

### 📚 [3311Lab1 – Java Library System with JML Contracts](https://github.com/sainashishegar/3311Lab1)
A Java-based simulation of a library system using **JML (Java Modeling Language)** to specify and verify program behavior. This project ensures correctness with pre- and post-conditions for methods like `addBook`, `removeBook`, and `findByTitle`.

> 🛠️ Java · JML · OOP  
> 🎯 Highlight: Applied software specification and design-by-contract principles

---

### 🧠 [AdCeption – Sugarscape AI Recommendation Simulator](https://github.com/jasminSlootweg/AdCeption)
An AI-driven simulation inspired by the Sugarscape model, visualized using **Solara + Mesa** in Python. Models how traders (AI agents) recommend ads to users based on content preferences, mimicking modern recommendation systems.

> 🛠️ Python · Mesa · Solara · Agent-Based Modeling  
> 🎯 Highlight: Smart agent behavior logic with relevance-based filtering

---

### ♟️ [OthelloAI-Java – Strategy-Based Console Game](https://github.com/sainashishegar/OthelloAI-Java)
A console-based Java game simulating Othello (Reversi), with multiple player strategies (Human, Random, Greedy AI). Modular and extensible using OOP and custom controller logic.

> 🛠️ Java · OOP · CLI  
> 🎯 Highlight: AI matchups using different strategies like greedy and random
